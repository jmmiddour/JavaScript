# JavaScript Notes

I have created this repository to house all the notes I take throughout my time taking different courses while on my self-taught learning journey of learning JavaScript. While Python is my first language, I have a very limited understanding of JavaScript. I have recently started working on an existing project which is coded in JavaScript and SQL. I am already proficient in Python and SQL. I have a little understanding of JavaScript, enough to get by on some prior projects I have created, but need to have a better understanding for the current existing project I am working on. 

I currently have a pro subscription to LinkedIn Learning, and I have also purchased some other paid courses to help with my learning journey. There will be links to the actual content of these courses, but you will not be able to access those links without paying for the courses directly. I will not include exact content from these courses, as they are paid courses and this is a public repository, but I will include my notes and some possible screenshots if needed to provide a better understanding for myself, as I am a better learner with visualization.

      JavaScript is the lingua franca of the web, but before using it to create dynamic websites, you need to understand how it works. In this course, Joe Chellman explores the syntax behind the JavaScript language. He shows how to "speak" JavaScript by gaining an understanding of variables, types, objects, arrays, operators, control structures, loops, and functions, through a series of hands-on examples that put these ideas into action. After completing this course, most developers will grasp the core syntax of JavaScript and how this scripting language works to build powerful and complex functionality on the web.
